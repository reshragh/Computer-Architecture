The code seems to work fine when attempts were made to play the game before submission.
Assumptions -
1. The maximum guesses is assumed to be 15. This will get displayed in its hex equivalent A on the last 7 segment display, if player 2 makes that many guesses before finding the number entered by player 1.  
2. The leds used to blink upon a correct guess are assumed to be the 4 leds next to the switches 3:0. 
3. Switch 5 is assumed to remain at high once player 2 gets her/his turn.
4. Only when the player has entered the guess should switch 4 be moved from low to high and then to low.
